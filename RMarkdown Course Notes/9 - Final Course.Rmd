# Introduction

Here, we'll get an introduction into machine the basics that underlie machine learning, including how to implement simple ML algorithms in R and evaluating their accuracy.

## Notation

In Machine Learning, we're interested in two types of data: the outcome we want to predict, and the features we will use to predict it.

The machine learning approach: we _train_ an algorithm to use a dataset for which we do know the outcome, and then apply this algorithm to new data to predict outcomes we don't know.

Here we will use $Y$ to denote the outcome and $X_1, \dots, X_p$ to denote *features*. Note that features are sometimes referred to as *predictors* or *covariates*.

Prediction problems come in two types: *categorical* and *continuous* outcomes. For categorical outcomes $Y$ can be any one of $K$ classes. 

 $K$ is usually represented as $k=1,\dots,K$ or $k=0,1$ for binaries.

To _build a model_ that provides a prediction for any set of values $X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \dots X_5=x_5$, we collect data for which we know the outcome:

To assess accuracy, we want to see whether $\hat{Y}$, our prediction, matches the *actual outcome*.

## Categorical versus Continuous

The outcome $Y$ can be categorical (which digit, what word, spam or not spam, pedestrian or empty road ahead) or continuous (movie ratings, housing prices, stock value, distance between driverless car and a pedestrian). The task of a machine learning algorithm is to *classify* categorical variables and *predict* continuous ones. Classifications are either right or wrong, and predictions have an *error* equal to their difference from the true value.


## An example 

Let's start with an example: a zip code reader. The first thing that happens to a letter when they are received in the post office is that they are sorted by zip code:

Step 1: Define the features, $X$, and outcomes, $Y$. In our training set, we have the true outcome, a number, specifed by a human. We convert the image into $28 \times 28 = 784$ pixels and obtain a grey scale intensity between 0 (white) to 255 (black). The value of each pixel can be seen below.

```{r digit-images-example, cache=TRUE}
mnist <- read_mnist()
tmp <- lapply( c(1,4,5), function(i){
    expand.grid(Row=1:28, Column=1:28) %>%  
      mutate(id=i, label=mnist$train$label[i],  
             value = unlist(mnist$train$images[i,])) 
})
tmp <- Reduce(rbind, tmp)
tmp %>% ggplot(aes(Row, Column, fill=value)) + 
    geom_point(pch=21) + 
    scale_y_reverse() +
    scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high="black") +
    facet_grid(.~label)
```


For each digitized image $i$ we have a categorical outcome $Y_i$ which can be one of 10 values: $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ and features $X_{i,1}, \dots, X_{i,784}$. Bold face distinguishes $\mathbf{X}_i = (X_{i,1}, \dots, X_{i,784})$ the vector of predictors from the individual predictors. When referring to an arbitrary set of features we drop the index $i$ and use $Y$ and $\mathbf{X} = (X_{1}, \dots, X_{784})$. Upper case denotes a random variable, while lower case, for example $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}$, denotes observed values. We'll stick to lowercase when coding.

# Conditional probabilities and expectations

## Conditional probabilities

Put simply, our goal is to create a series of conditional probabilities for each of the classes, $k$, present in the data. We use the notation $(X_1 = x_1,\dots,X_p=x_p)$ to represent the fact that we have observed values $x_1,\dots,x_n$ for covariates $X_1, \dots, X_p$. This does not imply that the outcome $Y$ will take a specific value. Instead, it implies a specific probability. Specifically, we denote the _conditional probabilities_  for each class $k$:

$$
\mbox{Pr}(Y=k \mid X_1 = x_1,\dots,X_p=x_p), \, \mbox{for}\,k=1,\dots,K
$$

To simplify the above, we write the following: $\mathbf{X} \equiv (X_1,\dots,X_p)$ and $\mathbf{x} \equiv (x_1,\dots,x_p)$. We will also use the following notation for the conditional probability of being class $k$. 

$$
p_k(\mathbf{x}) = \mbox{Pr}(Y=k \mid \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}), \, \mbox{for}\, k=1,\dots,K
$$



We use this series of conditional probabilities to construct our algorithm: For any given $\mathbf{x}$ we will predict class $k$ with the largest probability among $p_1(x), p_2(x), \dots p_K(x)$. In mathematical notation, we express this as:

$$\hat{Y} = \max_k p_k(\mathbf{x})$$

This is known as _Bayes' Rule_, but it is theoretical since we don't actually know the conditional probabilities, $p_k(\mathbf{x}), k=1,\dots,K$. The better our estimate, $\hat{p}_k(\mathbf{x})$, the better our ability to predict outcomes. Our estimate is expressed as follows:

$$\hat{Y} = \max_k \hat{p}_k(\mathbf{x})$$

Our ability to predict depends on two factors:

1) $\max_k p_k(\mathbf{x})$ is to 1 (i.e. our theoretical ability to predict an outcome)
2) Our  $\hat{p}_k(\mathbf{x})$ is to $p_k(\mathbf{x})$. We can't do anything about the first restriction as it is determined by the nature of the problem so our energy goes into finding ways to best estimate conditional probabilities. The first restriction does imply that we have limits as to how well even the best possible algorithm can perform. You should get used to the idea that while in some challenges we will be able to achieve almost perfect accuracy, digit readers for example, in others our success is restricted by the randomness of the process, movie recommendations for example. 

Before we continue note that defining our prediction by maximizing the probability is not always optimal in practice and depends on the context. As discussed above, sensitivity and specificity may differ in importance. But even in these cases, having a good estimate of the $p_k(x), k=1,\dots,K$ will suffice for us to build optimal prediction models since we can control the balance between specificity and sensitivity however we wish. For example, we can simply change the cutoffs used to predict one outcome or the other. In the plane example, we may ground the plane anytime the probability of malfunction is higher than 1 in a million as opposed to the default 1/2 used when error types are equally undesired. 

## Conditional expectations

For binary data, you can think of the probability $\mbox{Pr}(Y=1 \mid \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x})$ as the proportion of 1s in the stratum of the population for which $\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}$. Many of the algorithms we will learn can be applied to both categorical and continuous data due to the connection between _conditional probabilities_ and _conditional expectations_. 

Because the expectation is the average of values $y_1,\dots,y_n$ in the population, in the case in which the $y$s are 0 or 1, the expectation is equivalent to the probability of randomly picking a one since the average is simply the proportion of ones: 

$$
\mbox{E}(Y \mid \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x})=\mbox{Pr}(Y=1 \mid \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}).
$$

We therefore often only use the expectation to denote both the conditional probability and conditional expectation.

Just like with categorical outcomes, in most applications the same observed predictors does not guarantee the same continuous outcomes. Instead we assume that the outcome follows the same conditional distribution and we will now explain why we use the conditional expectation to define our predictors. 

## The Loss Function

Before we start describing approaches to optimizing the way we build algorithms for continuous data, we first need to define what we mean when we say one approach is better than another. Specifically, we need to quantify what we mean by "better".

With binary outcomes we have already described how sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and $F_1$ can be used as quantifications. However, these metrics are not useful for continuous outcomes. The general approach to defining "best" in machine leaning is to define a _loss function_. The most commonly used one is the squared loss function: if $\hat{y}$ is our predictor and $y$ is the observed outcome, the squared loss function is simply:

$$
(\hat{y} - y)^2
$$

Because we often have a test set with many observations, say $N$, we use the mean squared error (MSE):

$$
\mbox{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \mbox{RSS} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$

In practice we often report the root mean squared error 
becuase it is in the same units as the outcomes:


$$
\mbox{RMSE} = \sqrt{\mbox{MSE}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}
$$

 But doing the math is oftern easier with the MSE and is therefore more commonly used in text books, since these often describe theoretical properties of algorithms.

Note that if the outcomes are binary, both RMSE and MSE are equivalent to accuracy since $(\hat{y} - y)^2$ is 1 if the prediction was correct and 0 otherwise. In general, our goal is to build an algorithm that minimize the loss so it is as close to 0 as possible.

Because our data is usually a random sample, we can think of the MSE a random variable and the observed MSE can be thought of as an estimate of the expeced MSE, which in mathematical notation we write like this:

$$
\mbox{E}\left\{ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{Y}_i - Y_i)^2 \right\}
$$

Note that this is a theoretical concept because in practice we only have one dataset to work with. But in theory, we think of having a very very large number, call it $B$, of random samples, apply our algorithm to each,  obtain an MSE for each random sample, and think of the expected MSE as:

$$
\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \left(\hat{y}_i^b - y_i^b\right)^2 
$$

with $y_{i}^b$ denoting the $i$th observation in the $b$-th random sample and $\hat{y}_i^b$ the resulting prediction obtained from applying the exact same algorithm to the $b$-th random sample. But again, in practice, we only observe one random sample so the expected MSE is only theortical. However, in a later section we describe an approach to estimating the MSE that tries to mimic this theoretical quantity.

Before we continue, note that the there are loss functions other that the squared loss. For example the _Mean Absolute Error_  uses absolute values instead of squaring the errors:



$$
\mbox{E}\left\{ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N |\hat{Y}_i - Y_i|\right\}
$$

But in this book we focus on minimizing square loss since it is the most widely used.

## Conditional expectation minimizes squared loss function

So why do we care about the conditional expectation in machine learning? This is because the expected value has an attractive mathematical property: it minimized the MSE. Specifically, of all possible predictors $\hat{Y}$,

$$
\hat{Y} = \mbox{E}(Y \mid \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}) \, \mbox{ minimizes } \, \mbox{E}\{ (\hat{Y} - Y)^2  \mid  \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x} \}
$$ 

Due to this property, a succinct description of the main task of Machine Learning is that we use data to estimate

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \mbox{E}( Y  \mid  \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x} )
$$

for any set of features $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_p)$. This of course easier said than done, since this function can take any shape and $p$ can be very large. Consider a case in which we only have one predictor $x$. The expectation $\mbox{E}\{ Y  \mid  X=x \}$ can be any function of $x$: a line, a parabola, a sine wave, a step function, anything. It get's even more complicated when we consider cases with large $p$ in which case $f(\mathbf{x})$ is a function a multidimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$. For example, in our digit reader example $p = 784$! **The main way in which competing Machine Learning algorithms differ is in the approach to estimating this expectation.**

# The confusion matrix, prevalence, sensitivity and specificity

We start by briefly introducing  the `caret` package, which has several useful functions for building and assessing machine learning methods. 

```{r}
library(caret)
```

Later in this chapter we provide more details on this package. 

In this section we focus on describing ways in which machine learning algorithms are evaluated. For our first introduction to machine learning concepts we will start with a boring and simple example: predict sex using height. As we explain machine learning step by step and this example will let us set down the first building block. Soon enough we will be attacking more interesting challenges.

For this first example we use the height data in dslabs:

```{r}
data(heights)
```

We start by defining the outcome and predictors. In this example we have only one predictor.

```{r}
y <- heights$sex
x <- heights$height
```

This is clearly a categorical outcome since $Y$ can be `Male` or `Female` and we only have one predictor: height.
We know that we will not be able to predict $Y$ very accurately based on $X$ because male and female average heights are not that different relative to within group variability. But we can we do better than guessing? To answer this question we need to quantitative definition of better. 

## Training and test sets

Ultimately a machine learning algorithm is evaluated on how it performs in the real world with completely new datasets. However, when developing an algorithm we usually have a dataset for which we know the outcomes, as we do with the heights: we know the sex of every student in our dataset. Therefore, to mimic the ultimate evaluation process we typically split the data into two and act as if we don't know the outcome for one of these. We stop pretending we don't know to outcome to evaluate the algorithm, but only *after* we are done constructing it. We refer to the group for which we know the outcome and use to develop the algorithm as the _training_ set and the group for which we pretend we don't know the outcome as the _test_ sets. 

A standard way of generating the training and test sets is by randomly splitting the data.
The caret package includes the function `createDataPartition` that helps us generates indexes for randomly splitting the data into  training and test sets: 


```{r}
set.seed(2)
test_index <- createDataPartition(y, times = 1, p = 0.5, list = FALSE)
```

The argument `times` is used to define how many random samples of indexes to return, the argument `p` is used to define what proportion of the data represented by the index, and the argument `list` is used to decide if we want the indexes returned as a list or not.
We can use the result of the function call to define the training and test sets like this:

```{r}
test_set <- heights[test_index, ]
train_set <- heights[-test_index, ]
```

We will now develop an algorithm using **only** the training set. Once we are done developing the algorithm we will _freeze_ it and evaluate it using the test set. The simplest way to evaluate the algorithm when the outcomes are categorical is by simply reporting the proportion of cases that were correctly predicted **in the test set**. This metric is usually referred to as _overall accurarcy_.

## Overall accuracy

To demonstrate the use of overall accuracy we will build two competing algorithms and compare them.

Let's start by developing the simplest possible machine algorithm: guessing the outcome.

```{r}
y_hat <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_index), replace = TRUE) 
```

Note that we are completely ignoring the predictor and simply guessing the sex. 

In machine learning applications, it is useful to use factors to represent the categorical outcomes because R functions developed for machine learning, such as those in the caret package, require or recommend that categorical outcomes be coded as factors. So convert `y_hat` to factors using the `factor` function:

```{r}
y_hat <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_index), replace = TRUE) %>% 
  factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
```

The _overall accuacy_ is simply defined as the overall proportion that is predicted correctly:

```{r}
mean(y_hat == test_set$sex)
```

Not surprisingly, our accuracy is about 50%. We are guessing!

Can we do better? Exploratory data analysis suggests we can because, on average, males are slightly taller than females:

```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(mean(height), sd(height))
```

But how do we make use of this insight? Let's try another simple approach: predict `Male` if height is within a two standard deviations from the average male:

```{r}
y_hat <- ifelse(x > 62, "Male", "Female") %>% factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
```

The accuracy goes up from 0.50 to about 0.80:

```{r}
mean(y == y_hat)
```

But can we do even better? In the example above we used a cutoff of 62, but we can examine the accuracy obtained for other cutoffs and then pick the value that provides the best results. But remember, **it is important that we optimize the cutoff using only the training set**: the test set is only for evaluation. Although for this simplistic example it is not much of a problem, later we will learn that evaluating an algorithm on the training set can lead to _overfitting_, which often results in dangerously over-optimistic assessments. 

Here we examine the accuracy of 10 different cutoffs and pick the one yielding the best result.

```{r}
cutoff <- seq(61, 70)
accuracy <- map_dbl(cutoff, function(x){
  y_hat <- ifelse(train_set$height > x, "Male", "Female") %>% factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
  mean(y_hat == train_set$sex)
})
```

We can make a plot showing the accuracy on the training set for males and females.

```{r accuracy-v-cutoff, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(cutoff, accuracy) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cutoff, accuracy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() 
```

We see that the maximum value is:

```{r}
max(accuracy)
```

which is much higher than 0.5. The cutoff resulting in this accuracy is:

```{r}
best_cutoff <- cutoff[which.max(accuracy)]
best_cutoff
```

Now we can now test this cutoff on our test set to make sure our accuracy is not overly optimistic:

```{r}
y_hat <- ifelse(test_set$height > best_cutoff, "Male", "Female") %>% factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
y_hat <- factor(y_hat)
mean(y_hat == test_set$sex)
```

We see that it is a bit lower than the accuracy observed for the training set, but it is still better than guessing. And by testing on a dataset that we did no train on, we know it is not due to cherry-picking a good result.

## The Confusion Matrix

The prediction rule we developed in the previous section predicts `Male` if the student's is taller than 64 inches. Given that the average female is about 65 inches this prediction rule seems wrong. What happened? If a student is the height of the average female, shouldn't we predict `Female`? 

Generally speaking, overall accuracy can be a deceptive measure. To see this we will start by constructing what is referred to as the _confusion matrix_, which basically tabulates each combination of prediction and actual value. We can do this in R using the function `table`:

```{r}
table(predicted = y_hat, actual = test_set$sex)
```

If we study this table closely it reveals a problem. If we compute the accuracy separately for each sex we get:

```{r}
test_set %>% 
  mutate(y_hat = y_hat) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(accuracy = mean(y_hat == sex))
```

There is an imbalance in the accuracy for males and females: too many females are predicted to be male. We are calling close to half of the females, males! How can our overall accuracy be so high then?  This because the _prevalance_ of males in this dataset is high. These heights were collected from three data sciences courses, two of which had more males enrolled:


```{r}
prev <- mean(y == "Male")
prev
```

So when computing overall accuracy, the high percentage of mistakes made for females is outweighed by the gains in correct calls for men. **This can actually be a big problem in machine learning**. If your training data is biased in some way, you are likely to develop an algorithms that are biased as well. The fact that we used a test set does not matter because it is also derived from the original, biased, dataset. This is one of the reasons we look at metrics other than overall accuracy when evaluating a machine learning algorithm.

There are several metrics that we can evaluate an algorithm in a way that prevalence does not cloud our assessment, and these can all be derived from the confusion matrix. A general improvement to using overall accuracy is to study _sensitivity_ and _specificity_ separately. 

## Sensitivity and Specificity 

To define sensitivity and specificity we need a binary outcome. When the outcomes are categorical we can define these terms for a specific category. In the digits example we can ask for the specificity in the case of correctly predicting 2 as opposed to some other digit. Once we specify a category of interest then we can talk about positive outcomes, $Y=1$, and negative outcomes, $Y=0$.

In general, _sensitivity_ is defined as the ability of an algorithm to predict a positive outcome when the actual outcome is positive: call $\hat{Y}=1$ whenever $Y=1$. Because an algorithm that calls everything positive ($\hat{Y}=1$ no matter what) has perfect sensitivity, this metric on its own is not enough to judge an algorithm. For this reason we also examine _specificity_, which is generally defined as the ability of an algorithm to not to predict a positive $\hat{Y}=0$ when the actual outcome is not a positive $Y=0$. We can summarize in the following way:

* High sensitivity: $Y=1 \implies \hat{Y}=1$
* High specificity: $Y=0 \implies \hat{Y} = 0$

Another way to define specificity is by the proportion of positive calls that are actually positive:

* High specificity:  $\hat{Y}=1 \implies Y=1$.

To provide a precise definitions we name the four entries of the confusion matrix:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mat <- matrix(c("True positives (TP)", "False negatives (FN)", 
                "False positives (FP)", "True negatives (TN)"), 2, 2)
colnames(mat) <- c("Actually Positive", "Actually Negative")
rownames(mat) <- c("Predicted positve", "Predicted negative")
as.data.frame(mat) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Sensitivity is typically quantified by $TP/(TP+FN)$, or the proportion of actual positives (the first column or $TP+FN$) that are called positives `TP`. This quantity is referred to as the _true positive rate_ (TPR) or _recall_. 

Specificity is typically quantified as $TN/(TN+FP)$ or the proportion of negatives (the second column or $FP+TN$) that are called negatives `TN`. This quantity is s is also called the true negative rate (TNR). There is another way of quantifying specificity which is $TP/(TP+FP)$ or the proportion of outcomes called positives (the first row or $TP+FP$) that are actually positives $TP$. This quantity is referred to as _precision_ and also as _positive predictive value (PPV)_. Note that unlike TPR and TNR, precision depends on prevalence since higher prevalence implies you can get higher precision even when guessing. 

The multiple names can be confusing, so we include a table to help us remember the terms. The table includes a column that shows the definition if we think of the proportions as probabilities.

| A measure of | Name 1 | Name 2 | Definition | Probability representation |
|------|:--------------:|:------:|:----------:|:--------------------------:|
Sensitivity | True positive rate (TPR) | Recall | $TP / (TP + FN)$ | $\mbox{Pr}(\hat{Y}=1 \mid Y=1)$ |
Specificity | True negative rate (TNR) | 1 minus false positive rate (1-FPR) | $TN / (TN+FP)$ | $\mbox{Pr}(\hat{Y}=0 \mid Y=0)$ |
Specificity | Positive Predictive value (PPV) | Precision | $TP / (TP+FP)$ | $\mbox{Pr}(Y=1 \mid \hat{Y}=1)$|

The caret function `confusionMatrix` computes all these metrics for us once we define what a positive is. The function expects factors as input and the first level is considered the "positive" outcome or $Y=1$. One our example `Female` is the first level because it comes before `Male` alphabetically:

```{r}
confusionMatrix(data = y_hat, reference = test_set$sex)
```

We can see that the high overall accuracy is possible despite relatively low sensitivity. As we hinted at above, the reason this happens is the low prevalence (0.23): the proportion of females is low. Because prevalence is low, failing to call actual females as females (low sensitivity) does not lower the accuracy as much as it would have increased if incorrectly called males females. This is an example of why it is important to examine sensitivity and specificity and not just accuracy. Before applying this algorithm to general data sets we need to ask ourselves if prevalence will be the same.


## Balanced accuracy and $F_1$ score

Although in general we recommend studying both specificity and sensitivity, very often it is useful to have a one number summary, for example for optimization purposes. One metric that is preferred over overall accuracy is the average of specificity and sensitivity, refereed to as _balanced accuracy_. Because specificity and sensitivity are rates, it is more appropriate to compute the _harmonic_ average of specificity and sensitivity. In fact the _$F_1$-score_, a widely used one number summary, is the harmonic average of precision and recall:

$$
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\mbox{recall}} + 
    \frac{1}{\mbox{precision}}\right) }
$$

Because it is easier to write, you often see this harmonic average rewritten as

$$
2\frac{\mbox{precision} \cdot \mbox{recall}}
{\mbox{precision} + \mbox{recall}}
$$

when defining $F_1$. 

Note that depending on the context, some type of errors are more costly than others. For example, in the case of plane safety it is much more important to maximize sensitivity over specificity: failing to predicting a plane will malfunction before it crashes is a much more costly error than grounding a plane when in fact the plane is in perfect condition. In a capital murder criminal case the opposite is true since a false positive can lead to killing an innocent person. The $F_1$-score can be adapted to weigh specificity and sensitivity differently. To do this we define $\beta$ to represent how much more important sensitivity is compared to specificity and consider a weighted harmonic average:

$$
\frac{1}{\frac{\beta^2}{1+\beta^2}\frac{1}{\mbox{recall}} + 
    \frac{1}{1+\beta^2}\frac{1}{\mbox{precision}} }
$$


The `F_meas` function in the caret package computes this summary with `beta` defaulting to 1.


Let's rebuild our prediction algorithm, but this time maximizing the F-score instead of overall accuracy:

```{r}
cutoff <- seq(61, 70)
F_1 <- map_dbl(cutoff, function(x){
  y_hat <- ifelse(train_set$height > x, "Male", "Female") %>% factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
  F_meas(data = y_hat, reference = factor(train_set$sex))
})
```

As before, we can plot these $F_1$ measures versus the cutoffs:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(cutoff, F_1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cutoff, F_1)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() 
```

We see that it is maximized at $F_1$ value of :

```{r}
max(F_1)
```

when we use cutoff:
```{r}
best_cutoff <- cutoff[which.max(F_1)]
best_cutoff
```

A cutoff of 66 makes much more sense than 64. Furthermore, it balances the specificity and sensitivity of our confusion matrix:

```{r}
y_hat <- ifelse(test_set$height > best_cutoff, "Male", "Female") %>% factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
confusionMatrix(data = y_hat, reference = test_set$sex)
```

We now see that we do much better than guessing and that both sensitivity and specificity are relatively high and we have built our first machine learning algorithm. It takes height as a predictor and predicts female if you are 66 inches or shorter. 


## Prevalence matters in practice

A machine learning algorithm with very high sensitivity and specificity may not be useful in practice when prevalence is close to either 0 or 1. To see this consider the case of a doctor that specializes in a rare disease and is interested in developing a algorithm to predicting who has the disease. The doctor shares data with you and you develop an algorithm with very high sensitivity. You explain that this means that if a patient has the disease the algorithm is very likely to predict correctly. You also tell the doctor that you are also concern because, based on the dataset you analyzed the 1/2 the patients have the disease: $\mbox{Pr}(\hat{Y}=1)$. The doctor is neither concerned nor impressed and explains
that what is important is the precision of the test: $\mbox{Pr}(Y=1 | \hat{Y}=1)$. Using Bayes theorem we can connect the two measures:

$$ \mbox{Pr}(Y \mid \hat{Y}=1) = \mbox{Pr}(\hat{Y}=1 \mid Y=1) \frac{\mbox{Pr}(Y=1)}{\mbox{Pr}(\hat{Y}=1)}$$

The doctor knows that the prevalence of the disease is 5 in 1000 which implies that $\mbox{Pr}(Y=1) \, / \,\mbox{Pr}(\hat{Y}=1) = 1/100$ and therefore the precision of your algorithm is less than 0.01. The doctor does not have much use for your algorithm.


## ROC and precision-recall curves

When comparing the two methods: guessing versus using a height cutoff, we looked at accuracy and $F_1$. The second method clearly outperformed. 
However, while for the second method we considered several cutoffs, for the first we only considered one approach: guessing with equal probability. Note that guessing `Male` with higher probability would give us higher accuracy due to the bias in the sample:


```{r}
p <- 0.9
y_hat <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_index), replace = TRUE, prob=c(p, 1-p)) %>% 
  factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
mean(y_hat == test_set$sex)
```

But, as described above, this would come at the cost of lower sensitivity. The curves we describe in this section will help us see this.

Note that for each of these parameters we can get a different sensitivity and specificity. For this reason a very common approach to evaluating methods is to compare them graphically by plotting both.

A widely used plot that does this is the _receiver operating characterstic_ (ROC) curve. If you are wondering where this name comes from, according to Wikipedia:

>> The ROC curve was first used during World War II for the analysis of radar signals before it was employed in signal detection theory.[35] Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States army began new research to increase the prediction of correctly detected Japanese aircraft from their radar signals. For this purposes they measured the ability of radar receiver operators to make these important distinctions, which was called the Receiver Operating Characteristics.


The ROC curve plots sensitivity (TPR) versus 1 - specificity or the false positive rate (FPR). Here is an ROC curve for guessing sex but using different probabilities of guessing male:

```{r}
probs <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 10)
guessing <- map_df(probs, function(p){
  y_hat <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_index), replace = TRUE, prob=c(p, 1-p)) %>% 
    factor(levels = c("Female", "Male"))
  list(method = "Guessing",
       FPR = 1 - specificity(y_hat, test_set$sex),
       TPR = sensitivity(y_hat, test_set$sex))
})
guessing %>% qplot(FPR, TPR, data =., xlab = "1 - Specificity", ylab = "Sensitivity")
```

The ROC curve for guessing always looks like a straight line. Note that a perfect algorithm would shoot straight to 1 and stay up there: perfect sensitivity for all value of specificity. SO how does our second approach compare? We can construct an ROC curve for  the height based approach.

```{r}
cutoffs <- c(50, seq(60, 75), 80)
height_cutoff <- map_df(cutoffs, function(x){
  y_hat <- ifelse(test_set$height > x, "Male", "Female") %>% 
    factor(levels = c("Female", "Male"))
   list(method = "Height cutoff",
        FPR = 1-specificity(y_hat, test_set$sex),
        TPR = sensitivity(y_hat, test_set$sex))
})
```

By plotting both curves together we are able to compare sensitivity for different values of specificity.

```{r}
bind_rows(guessing, height_cutoff) %>%
  ggplot(aes(FPR, TPR, color = method)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("1 - Specificity") +
  ylab("Sensitivity")
```

We can see that we obtain higher sensitivity with this approach for all values of specificity which imply it is in fact a better method.

Note that when making ROC curves it is often nice to add the cutoff used to the points:

```{r}
map_df(cutoffs, function(x){
  y_hat <- ifelse(test_set$height > x, "Male", "Female") %>% 
    factor(levels = c("Female", "Male"))
   list(method = "Height cutoff",
        cutoff = x, 
        FPR = 1-specificity(y_hat, test_set$sex),
        TPR = sensitivity(y_hat, test_set$sex))
}) %>%
  ggplot(aes(FPR, TPR, label = cutoff)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(nudge_y = 0.01)
```


ROC curves have on weakness and it is that neither of the measures plotted depend on prevalence. In case in which prevalence matters, we may instead make a precision-recall plot. The idea is similar but we instead plot precision against recall:


```{r}
guessing <- map_df(probs, function(p){
  y_hat <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_index), replace = TRUE, prob=c(p, 1-p)) %>% factor(levels = c("Female", "Male"))
  list(method = "Guess",
    recall = sensitivity(y_hat, test_set$sex),
    precision = precision(y_hat, test_set$sex))
})

height_cutoff <- map_df(cutoffs, function(x){
  y_hat <- ifelse(test_set$height > x, "Male", "Female") %>% factor(levels = c("Female", "Male"))
  list(method = "Height cutoff",
       recall = sensitivity(y_hat, test_set$sex),
    precision = precision(y_hat, test_set$sex))
})
bind_rows(guessing, height_cutoff) %>%
  ggplot(aes(recall, precision, color = method)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

From this plot we immediately see that the precision of guessing is not high. This is because the prevalence is low. 

If we change positives to mean Male instead of Female the ROC curve remains the same, but the precision recall plot changes:


```{r}
guessing <- map_df(probs, function(p){
  y_hat <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_index), replace = TRUE, prob=c(p, 1-p)) %>% factor(levels = c("Male", "Female"))
  list(method = "Guess",
    recall = sensitivity(y_hat, relevel(test_set$sex, "Male", "Female")),
    precision = precision(y_hat, relevel(test_set$sex, "Male", "Female")))
})

height_cutoff <- map_df(cutoffs, function(x){
  y_hat <- ifelse(test_set$height > x, "Male", "Female") %>% factor(levels = c("Male", "Female"))
  list(method = "Height cutoff",
       recall = sensitivity(y_hat, relevel(test_set$sex, "Male", "Female")),
    precision = precision(y_hat, relevel(test_set$sex, "Male", "Female")))
})
bind_rows(guessing, height_cutoff) %>%
  ggplot(aes(recall, precision, color = method)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

## ROC

With the example we have been examining we can make two types of errors: calling a 2 a 7 or calling a 7 a 2. More generally, we binary data we call these false positives (calling a 0 a 1) and false negatives (calling a 1 a 0). Here we have arbitrarily made 7s 1s and 2s 0s.  

This concept is important in many areas and in particular in health where one type of mistake can be much more costly than another. Note that we have been predicting 1s based on the rule $\hat{f}(x_1, x_2) > 0.5$ but we pick another cutoff, depending on how the cost of errors. For example, if we are predicting if a plane will malfunction, then we want a very low false negative rate and are willing to sacrifice our true positive rate. 

We can see that the estimated probabilities are in a continuum:


```{r}
params <- train_set %>% group_by(y) %>% 
  summarize(avg_1 = mean(X_1), avg_2 = mean(X_2), 
            sd_1= sd(X_1), sd_2 = sd(X_2), 
            r = cor(X_1,X_2))
p0 <- get_p(params[1,], dat= test_set)
p1 <- get_p(params[2,], dat= test_set)
pi <- 0.5
pred_qda <- pi*p1/(pi*p1 + (1-pi)*p0)
test_set %>% mutate(pred=pred_qda, label=as.factor(y)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(label,pred)) + geom_boxplot()
```

The Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve plots true positive rate versus false positive rates for several choices of cutoff. We can create this curve with the following code:

```{r}
library(pROC)

roc_qda <- roc(test_set$y, pred_qda)
plot(roc_qda)
```

Here are the results for LDA

```{r}
params <-params %>% mutate(sd_1 = mean(sd_1), 
                           sd_2 = mean(sd_1), 
                           r=mean(r))
p0 <- get_p(params[1,], dat = test_set)
p1 <- get_p(params[2,], dat = test_set)
pi <- 0.5
pred_lda <- pi*p1/(pi*p1 + (1-pi)*p0)

roc_lda <- roc(test_set$y, pred_lda)
plot(roc_qda)
plot(roc_lda, add=TRUE, col=2)
```

We can also compare to kin

```{r}
fit <- knn3(y~., data = train_set, k=5)
pred_knn_5 <- predict(fit, newdata = test_set)[,2]
roc_knn_5 <- roc(test_set$y, pred_knn_5)
plot(roc_qda)
plot(roc_knn_5, add=TRUE, col=3)

fit <- knn3(y~., data = train_set, k=51)
pred_knn_51 <- predict(fit, newdata = test_set)[,2]
roc_knn_51 <- roc(test_set$y, pred_knn_51)
plot(roc_qda)
plot(roc_knn_51, add=TRUE, col=4)
```
