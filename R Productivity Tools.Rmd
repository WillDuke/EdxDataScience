##Using Unix

###The Terminal

Access a terminal window in R via Tools > Terminal > New Terminal.

The following function can be run in the terminal screen which returns the string in quotes:

`echo "hello world"`

*hello world*

###Recommended Directory Structure

###Unix Commands

**Working Directory**  

* `pwd` prints the *full path* current working directory  
* `~` is a shorthand for within the current directory (e.g. `~/docs` in your working directory)
    + `cd ~/docs` will take us to `docs` no matter where it is relative to the current directory
* `ls` lists directory content  
* `mkdir` creates a new directory within the current working directory  
* `rmdir` removes a directory as long as it's empty
* `cd` changes the working directory to the directory specified after it (e.g. `cd projects`) 
    + `cd ~` returns you to the root (first parent) directory  
    + `cd ..` returns you to the parent directory one step above the working directory  
    + `cd .` keeps you in the current directory (`.` is a shorthand for the current directory)
    + `cd ../..` will take you to the parent of the parent of the working directory!
    + `cd -` returns you to the directory you just left
    + `cd` alone also returns you to the home directory
    + note: be sure to but `/` at the end of the directory you want to move to!
    
**Adding, Moving and Looking at Files**

* `mv` moves files or directories between directories as well as changing filenames  
    + e.g. `mv ~/docs/resumes/cv.tex ~/docs/reports/` moves `cv.tex` from `resumes` to `reports`
    + e.g. once in the working directory, `mv cv.tex resume.tex` changes the filename
    + note: to move a directory or file, ensure that there is a `/` at the end of your                 destination else the filename will change!
    + note: `mv` will replace a file without warning if you move a new one of the same name to         the same directory
* `cp` copies files into other directories with the same syntax as `mv`  
    + note: `cp` cannot copy directories without an argument  
* `rm` *permanently* removes files
    + note: one can list multiple files to remove simulataneously
    + note: to remove a directory requires an argment
* `less` shows the contents of a file
    + `q` exits the file viewer
    
**Preparing for a Data Science Project**

* Create all of the directories you need first
    + note: This is much easier than reorganizing after the fact!
